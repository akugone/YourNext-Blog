WILT => **W**hat **I** **L**earnt **T**oday

Every day, you discover some tips or really useful info while coding. I want to share it building WILT, a hub where web3 (and web2) devs bring their best daily coding tips.

This is a [Next.js] 13 (https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Stack
